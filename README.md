storiq-lib-bonding
==================

This is the network interface bonding management library for StorIQ.

Simply build the content of the repository as a Debian package after putting away the README and LICENSE files :

dpkg --build .  ../storiq-lib-bonding_<version>_all.deb

And install the package. The resulting package works (at least) on Squeeze and Wheezy.
